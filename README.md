# README.md Generator: Node.js and ES6+

## Description 

It is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, 
how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to 
use and contribute to the success of the project.
This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input 
about your project.
