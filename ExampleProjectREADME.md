Employee Directory is an application that is built using React.  When the application is rendered, it displays a list of employees by Name, Phone, Email and DOB (Date of BirthDOB).  This application can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on Name.  The user can also search for an employee in the search box by typing the name.
